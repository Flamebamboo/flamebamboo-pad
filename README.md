# Flamebamboo Pad

### Features

This is a 11 key macropad with a rotary encoder, an OLED Display that uses KMK firmware (for now)

### Inspirations

Recently I started my content creation journey on the internet where I document my game, app development journey. While I was making this project I decided to make a vlog to document everything from Day 1, making the schematic, pcb, 3D modelling. My content hasn't been consistent but I try my best to post daily. Overall its been 19 days since I started this project back in June 1st (there's some days I didn't work on it).
